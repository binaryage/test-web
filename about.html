<h2>TotalFinder is just a better Finder</h2>

<p><img src="/images/showcase/thumb-showcase-dual-mode.png" style="float:right; width:360px; margin-left: 20px; position: relative; top: -24px"></p>

<p>TotalFinder works like the original Finder but adds <a href="/tabs">tabs</a>, <a href="/dual-mode">dual panel</a>, <a href="/folders-on-top">folders on top</a> and other <a href="/tweaks">useful features</a>.</p>

<p>My goal is to improve Finder in areas where it is lacking but keep the overall design which is good in my opinion.</p>

<p>TotalFinder works in OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard). <a href="/lion">Some features</a> are also available in OSX 10.7 (Lion).</p>

<h2>TotalFinder is a plugin for Finder</h2>

<p>TotalFinder is an add-on which gets loaded into the Finder when you launch <code>TotalFinder.app</code>. It does not modify your Finder files on the disk.  It modifies the current instance of Finder running in memory. It works similar to <a href="http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php">SIMBL plugins</a> which you may know from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simbl/wiki/SIMBLPlugins">other programs</a>. However, TotalFinder is a standalone application and is not dependent on SIMBL and should work reliably alongside other SIMBL applications.</p>

<h2>System updates from Apple</h2>

<p>Due to the nature of how TotalFinder works, there is a small risk that TotalFinder might break with future Finder updates. I use TotalFinder myself on a daily basis so I am able to spot any potential problems very quickly. So far, Finder updates have introduced just minor cosmetic changes. I am also a member of Apple's Developer Program and have access to pre-release versions of system updates. I am committed to keeping TotalFinder compatible with Apple's updates.</p>

<p>Please remember that if you ever experience any problem whatsoever, it is extremely easy to <a href="/uninstallation">uninstall TotalFinder</a> and return to the Apple's basic Finder. And if you have any issues, please visit <a href="http://support.binaryage.com">our forums</a> or you can <a href="mailto:antonin@binaryage.com">email me directly</a>.</p>

<h2>How to restart Finder</h2>

<p>You can go to the Terminal.app and type:</p>

<pre><code>killall Finder 
</code></pre>

<p>This will restart Finder with an unaltered state. That means TotalFinder will not load automatically next time. To open TotalFinder again, launch TotalFinder.app in /Applications.</p>
