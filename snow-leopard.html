<p>Since Mountain Lion release I have dropped support for Snow Leopard. I understand this may disappoint you, but please let me focus on future. Historical TotalFinder versions work just fine with Snow Leopard, they just lack the latest features and bug fixes.</p>

<h2>The last Snow Leopard compatible version is <a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/changes#1.3.4">TotalFinder 1.3.4</a>.</h2>

<hr />

<p>I simply decided to support only last two OS versions. Currently Mountain Lion and Lion.</p>

<p>I wrote about my decision in <a href="http://blog.binaryage.com/totalfinder-runs-with-mountain-lions">this blog post</a>.</p>

<p>You may <a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/snow_leopard_not_supported_1_3_6">comment on it here</a>.</p>
