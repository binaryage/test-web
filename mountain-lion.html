<h2>Mountain Lion status</h2>

<p>Good news! The latest release of TotalFinder fully works under Mountain Lion (OSX 10.8).</p>

<p>I'm committed to bring all TotalFinder features to Mountain Lion.<br/>Also I will continue to support Lion in the foreseeable future. I have dropped support for Snow Leopard.</p>
