<h2>Trial Version</h2>

<div class="license-desk">
You may install TotalFinder and use it in trial mode for 14 days. Then you need to decide to buy it or uninstall it.
</div>


<p>The trial version displays an info badge in the top-right part of every window:</p>

<p><img src="/images/trial.png" class="doc-inline-image" style="left: 0px; margin-bottom: -20px"></p>

<p>After 14 days it starts showing the unregistered badge:</p>

<p><img src="/images/unregistered.png" class="doc-inline-image" style="left: 0px; margin-bottom: -20px"></p>

<p>This allows you to evaluate TotalFinder's functionality and decide whether you want to buy it or not.</p>

<h2>The license agreement</h2>

<p>When you buy a TotalFinder license you get my permission to use the software. Here is <a href="/license.txt">the legal code</a>.</p>

<div class="license-desk">
<p>You may use your license in either of two ways:</p>
<div class="choice">1. <strong>one user on multiple computers</strong> <span class="note">(as long as you are the only user using TotalFinder)</span></div>
<div class="example">Example: a desktop computer and a personal laptop which are both used exclusively by you</div>
<div class="choice">2. <strong>multiple users on a single computer</strong></div>
<div class="example">Example: a home computer which is shared by all family members</div>
</div>


<h2>Free licenses</h2>

<h2>Buying a license</h2>

<p><img src="/base/img/totalfinder-icon-shop.png" style="width: 32px; float: left; margin-right: 10px"></p>

<p>Please visit <a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/binaryage/product/store">the store</a> where you can purchase TotalFinder. It is easy and safe (powered by <a href="http://fastspring.com">FastSpring</a>).</p>

<h2>TotalFinder updates</h2>

<p>When you buy a license you may freely update to all TotalFinder versions within one major OS release. For example by buying TotalFinder today you will get free updates for all versions compatible with Lion (OS X 10.7).</p>

<p>A new major OS release (OS X 10.8?) will probably require substantial rewrites and intensive testing. I may charge existing users an upgrade fee for a new OS. I expect it to be 50% of the full price.</p>

<h2>TotalFinder and your privacy</h2>

<p>TotalFinder does not connect to or communicate over the network. It works perfectly on a computer disconnected from the internet.</p>

<p>There are two cases in which TotalFinder optionally sends data over the network:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/">Sparkle</a> updating system - when checking and downloading a new version.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.binaryage.com/crash-reporting-in-binaryage">Crash Reporting</a> dialog - when you explicitly click "Send Report..." button.</li>
</ul>


<h2>TotalFinder reliability</h2>

<p>I have tested TotalFinder with my system and I did my best to make it bug-free and stable. However it may still contain undiscovered bugs or issues.</p>

<div class="license-warning">
Also please note that I'm not in control of what Apple does with Finder in the future. Although unlikely, it may happen that some future update makes it impossible for me to adapt TotalFinder or some of its functionality to a new Finder version. By using this software you accept this risk.
</div>




<div class="license-exclamation">
You are using TotalFinder at your own risk. I'm not responsible for anything bad which could possibly happen using this software.
