<h2>Thanks for considering buying TotalFinder</h2>

<p>This should be really straight-forward. It should take less than 5 minutes in most cases.</p>

<h2>Buy a license from <a href="https://sites.fastspring.com/binaryage/instant/totalfinder">the web store</a></h2>

<div class="note">Please note that there is no point in ordering 2 licenses, because they cost the same as 3 licenses.</div>

<h2>Wait for an email with "TotalFinder License" in the subject</h2>

<p>In most cases you should get it instantly after the payment.</p>

<p>We all know that even important emails can sometimes end up in a spam folder. Please double check your spam before you <a href="mailto:antonin@binaryage.com">report a missing email</a>. I'm using <a href="http://fastspring.com">FastSpring</a> which is rock-solid, so a mistake by our mail robots is unlikely.</p>

<p>In my gmail the message looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/totalfinder-license-email.png" style="width: 600px"></p>

<p><a name="dialog"></a></p>

<h2>Enter your license into the Registration Dialog</h2>

<p>You may click on that ugly red window badge:</p>

<p><img src="/images/unregistered.png" class="doc-inline-image" style="left: 0px; margin-bottom: -20px"></p>

<p>Or you may go through Preferences / About / Register button.</p>

<p><img src="/images/totalfinder-registration.png"><br></p>

<p>Please make sure you copy and paste license information from the email exactly and without surrounding quotes.</p>

<p>Click Register and you get this happy screen if you did it right:</p>

<p>Thank you for registering and enjoy using TotalFinder!</p>

<p>And please <a href="mailto:support@binaryage.com">let me know</a> if you have any trouble completing your registration.</p>
